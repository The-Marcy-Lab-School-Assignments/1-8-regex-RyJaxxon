# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
When using regex, placing a `g` after our regex expression will allow us to replace all instances of a pattern. For example:
```
let str = "Take1out2all3these4numbers!"
console.log(str.replace(/\d/g, " ")) // Logs "Take out all these numbers!"
```
