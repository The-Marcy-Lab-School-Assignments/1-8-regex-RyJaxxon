# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
`\s` targets whitespace characters while `\b` targets a boundary of word, meaning the space in-between whitespace characters and the word. So if we want to only target that boundary and not the whitespace itself, we use `\b`.

# Teacher Feedback

AH! So close, one small correction,`\b` will target the boundary of a word but **not just the whitespace**! It will also look for the word/char even if it's next to an exclamation point or a part of another word!
