# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
Regex is extremely helpful when we need to target characters and numbers that we don't know ahead of time. For example, if we had to ensure that someones username did not include certain characters, we can use a regex expression to include all the characters we need to filter out.
